        <p>My first article is up and readable, containing some thoughts on the topic of the death 
        of the player in challenge-based games and why it frustrates or doesn't.</p>
        <p>The title is <a href="{{ url_for('article_single', article_name='a_good_death') }}">A Good Death</a>
         - please give it a read and - if you feel so inclined - contact me in the comments underneath or
        via the various contact methods in the footer.</p>

        <p>Hi there! Welcome to my burgeoning personal website. This is a first blog post of sorts, 
        assuming I keep writing these.</p>
        <p>Feel free to have a browse of what little I have here so far. It's game discussion and 
        analysis, if you're wondering. You can find a little more information in the
        <a href="{{ url_for('about') }}">about</a> page if you're interested.</p>
    </div>
