        <h2>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Firstly, feel free to skip ahead for {{ nav('games discussion and analysis', 'home', id='articles') }}
        and information on {{ nav("talks I've delivered", 'home', id='speaking') }}.</p>
        <p>This is the personal site of Tom Kitchin, when he remembers to update it.</p>
        <p>I'm currently based in Worthing in the south of England where I work as a freelance web developer.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, my primary field
        of interest is games and game design - crossing wildly between videogames, board games, roleplaying
        games and even megagames.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in game design, game analysis and discussion and in public speaking on those topics.
        If you're looking for someone with public speaking skills and a broad awareness of game design and the
        gaming industry, please check out my {{ nav('previous talks', 'home', id='speaking') }} and definitely
        {{ nav('contact me', 'home', id='contact') }}.</p>
        <p>I can be reached via my email at <strong><a href="mailto:tkitchin@gmail.com">tkitchin@gmail.com</a></strong>
        or on Twitter at <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/TwoDaemon">@TwoDaemon</a></strong>.</p>

    <section id="articles">
        <h2>Writing</h3>
        <p>Articles on a selection of gaming-related topics, generally about design elements and such.</p>
        <p>Style tends towards a sort of semi-informal topic analysis, although there will
        probably be a few less focused entries eventually in lieu of having a blog to put them on.</p>
        <ul class="article-list">
        {% for article in articles %}

        <h2>Speaking</h2>
