        <p>If you care who I am - hi there. I'm Tom, otherwise most easily found online as TwoDaemon.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in game design, game analysis and discussion and in public speaking on those topics. 
        If you're looking for someone with public speaking skills and a broad awareness of game design and the 
        gaming industry, please check out my {{ localnav('previous talks', 'speaking') }} and definitely

        <h2>Articles</h3>
        <p>Articles on a selection of gaming-related topics, generally about design elements and such.</p>
        <p>Style tends towards a sort of semi-informal topic analysis, although there will 
        probably be a few less focused entries eventually in lieu of having a blog to put them on.</p>
