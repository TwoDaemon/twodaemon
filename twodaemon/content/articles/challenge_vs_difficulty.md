title: Challenge vs. Difficulty
subtitle: Defining the difference between challenge and difficulty in games.
hidden: true

*Dark Souls* is not a hard game.

Well, that was a lie. It's basically goddamn nails. I should say: *Dark Souls* is not *only* a hard game.

It is, far more importantly, a challenging game. 

Allow me to explain the difference.

**Challenge is fought with skill, difficulty is fought with persistence.**

When we talk about a game being difficult, about it being *hard*, we might imagine beating 
our heads fruitlessly against the iron wall of gaming frustration. That it's something we'll defeat by 
luck or sheer attrition, a crevasse crossed on the bodies of a thousand reloaded savegames.

But then, we also might think of those games in which every threat and every problem 
demands just that little bit more of us, always pushing us, until we realise that in a thousand 
desperate steps we've climbed so very far we can barely see where we started, and that which once 
seemed insurmountable is now mere child's play.

These two things are not mutually exclusive.

**Difficulty** in games is something we hit right from the start, as we are asked a simple question.

Easy, medium, or hard?

Difficulty is a question of numbers. 

Is a wave made of eight enemies or fifteen? Would you like your foes to die in three shots or twelve? 
Should your shields withstand direct nuclear impact or fracture under the power of a child's slingshot? 

It has the advantage of being both simple and universal. 
Simple because you barely need to tune it, it's just a few more numbers in a machine for crunching numbers. 
Universal because another hundred hitpoints are inarguably one hundred hitpoints, factually 
harder for the simplest possible definition of 'hard'.

Earlier I said it is "fought with persistance". If he has twice as many hitpoints, just fight for twice as long. Problem solved.

It's not really quite that simple, but we'll get back to that.

**Challenge** in games is something which has to be laced throughout the entire design. It is a thing of craft, 
custom-made, and every player meets it differently. 

A situation is challenging when it tests the very limit of your skills and demands that you improve to meet it. 
The more it demands of you, the more challenging it is - that is, until it goes too far and becomes entirely beyond you, 
flatly impossible. 

Challenge can come in many forms. *Portal* is challenging, for it constantly demands you demonstrate new and greater 
ways of thinking with portals. *The Walking Dead* is challenging, as it forces you to make ever more difficult decisions 
against ever more unreasonable situations. 

And, of course, *Dark Souls* is challenging, because every foe, every boss, every bonfire is won through demonstrating 
ever-increasing mastery in fields from knowledge of your enemies and awareness of traps to the more obvious mastery of 
sword and shield.

In all of these cases challenge is found in improvement. Once the skill being challenged is fully mastered the challenge 
no longer represents a problem, it is no longer challenging.

The first time I played Dark Souls I stumbled early on into the depths of New Londo, an area not actually recommended for 
a picnic until much later in the game. There I challenged the Darkwraiths, black-armoured knights all. 

This wasn't my finest decision. Eventually, dismembered a hundred different ways, I retreated and found another path. Hours 
later I returned - this was my next destination, and this time I couldn't run away.

I squared up to the first Darkwraith, prepared myself for a terrible battle, raised my weapon, roared my battle cry.

I very nearly took the first blow from sheer confusion. It seemed so *slow*, its path so obvious, every attack a 
ridiculous pantomime of true combat. Dodge, block, dodge, stab *stab* and done. 

Effortless. 

Of course, in ten hours my skills had been advanced elsewhere until, far from the previous threat level, now a Darkwraith's 
skills were well within my mastery. No challenge remained. Had I not first visited them early I would never even have known 
them as 'strong'. 

That's the thing about challenge - it only matters if it nears your skill. 

5 + 2 + 3 is more difficult than 5 + 5, but hardly more challenging.
