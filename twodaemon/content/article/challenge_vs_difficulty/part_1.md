*Dark Souls* is not a hard game.

Well, that was a lie. It's basically goddamn nails. I should say: *Dark Souls* is not *only* a hard game.

The difference can be described in terms of **challenge** and **difficulty**, very different things.

**Challenge is fought with skill, difficulty is fought with persistence.**

When we talk about a game being difficult, about it being *hard*, we might imagine beating 
our heads fruitlessly against the iron wall of gaming frustration. That it's something we'll defeat by 
luck or sheer attrition, a crevasse crossed on the bodies of a thousand reloaded savegames.

But then, we also might think of those games in which every threat and every problem 
demands just that little bit more of us, always pushing us, until we realise that in a thousand 
desperate steps we've climbed so very far we can barely see where we started, and that which once 
seemed insurmountable is now mere child's play.

These two things are not mutually exclusive.

**Difficulty** in games is something we hit right from the start, as we are asked a simple question.

Easy, medium, or hard?

Difficulty is a question of numbers. 

Is a wave made of eight enemies or fifteen? Would you like your foes to die in three shots or twelve? 
Should your shields withstand direct nuclear impact or fracture under the power of a child's slingshot? 

It has the advantage of being both simple and universal. 
Simple because you barely need to tune it, it's just a few more numbers in a machine for crunching numbers. 
Universal because another hundred hitpoints are inarguably one hundred hitpoints, factually 
harder for the simplest possible definition of 'hard'.

Earlier I said it is "fought with persistance". If he has twice as many hitpoints, just fight for twice as long. Problem solved.

Obviously it's not quite that simple, but we'll get back to that.

**Challenge** in games is something laced throughout the entire design. It is a thing of craft, custom-made, 
subjective.
