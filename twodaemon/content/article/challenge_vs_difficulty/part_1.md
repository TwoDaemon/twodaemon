**Challenge** and **difficulty** are terms we like to throw around when discussing games, 
but if we're going to keep using them we should be clear on what we mean. After all, right now we 
live in a world in which people say that Dark Souls is *hard*.

If you don't understand why I have a problem with that statement, read on - this is for you.

**Challenge is subjective and fought with skill, difficulty is objective and fought with persistence.**

When we talk about something being difficult, about it being *hard*, we probably imagine beating 
our heads fruitlessly against the iron wall of gaming frustration. That it's something we'll beat by 
luck or sheer attrition, a crevasse crossed on the bodies of a thousand reloaded savegames.

But then, sometimes we also mean those beautiful games in which every threat and every problem 
demands just that little bit more of us, until we realise that in a thousand scrambled steps we've 
climbed so very far we can barely see where we started, and that which once seemed insurmountable is 
now mere child's play.

**Difficulty** in games is something we hit right from the start, as we are asked a simple question.

Easy, medium, or hard?
